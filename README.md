Learning Elements:

  - DOM
  - Manipulating, removing and adding DOM elements with JS

# Overview

Using JS to manipulate the DOM and generating div tags to a predefined HTML structure. I learned how nodes interact with eachother: Parent and child nodes and adding HTML content like text or in this case, changing the color of the squares. 

A current problem I'm facing right now is manipulating the size of the box, while inscreasing or decreasing the pixels within the limits of said box.
